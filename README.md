# Booking Model with Neural Network

This project implements a neural network-based booking model for predicting bookings or reservations in a given scenario. The model utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to construct and train the neural network architecture.

## Description

The booking model aims to predict the likelihood of a booking or reservation based on various input features such as time of booking, user demographics, historical booking data, and other relevant factors. By training a neural network on a dataset containing past booking information, the model learns patterns and relationships within the data to make accurate predictions about future bookings.

## Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: The model architecture is designed using TensorFlow and Keras, allowing for flexibility in defining the number of layers, units, activation functions, and other parameters.
  
- **Training Data**: The model is trained on a dataset containing historical booking information, including features such as time of booking, user information, booking channel, and other relevant factors.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, units per layer, and activation functions are tuned to optimize the model's performance and generalization ability.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's performance on both training and validation datasets.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the dataset containing historical booking information, ensuring that it includes relevant features and target labels.

2. **Model Training**: Train the neural network model using the prepared dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance and generalization ability.

4. **Prediction**: Once trained and evaluated, the model can be used to make predictions on new data, providing insights into the likelihood of bookings or reservations in different scenarios.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporating additional features: Expand the feature set used by the model to include more information that may impact booking decisions, such as weather data, economic indicators, or user behavior metrics.

- Model Optimization: Explore techniques for optimizing the neural network architecture and hyperparameters to improve performance and efficiency.

- Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment, making it accessible for real-time booking predictions and decision-making.
