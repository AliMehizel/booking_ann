# Booking Model with Neural Network

This project implements a neural network-based booking model for predicting bookings or reservations in a given scenario. The model utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to construct and train the neural network architecture.

## Description

The booking model aims to predict the likelihood of a booking or reservation based on various input features such as time of booking, user demographics, historical booking data, and other relevant factors. By training a neural network on a dataset containing past booking information, the model learns patterns and relationships within the data to make accurate predictions about future bookings.
